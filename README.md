# Graph-Algorithm-Visualizer-Java
Graph Algorithm Visualizer: A Java-based tool for visualizing and analyzing graph algorithms This project is a comprehensive Graph Algorithm Visualizer implemented in Java, designed to provide an interactive and educational experience for exploring various graph algorithms. Key features include:

Core Functionality
* Adjacency Map Digraph: Efficient representation of directed graphs using a double map structure
* Default Graph Generation: Automatic creation of sample graphs for quick visualization and testing
* JavaFX Visualization: Utilizes JavaFxSmartGraph library for dynamic and attractive graph rendering
  
Implemented Algorithms
* Dijkstra's Algorithm: Calculates and displays the shortest path between selected vertices
* Cycle Detection: Implements Depth-First Search (DFS) to identify and highlight cycles within the graph
  
Advanced Features
* Smart Placement Strategy: Employs SmartCircularSortedPlacementStrategy for optimal vertex arrangement
* Interactive UI: Allows users to manipulate graphs and observe algorithm execution in real-time
* Cycle Generation: Capability to add random edges until a cycle is formed, enhancing the learning experience
  
This project serves as an excellent tool for students, educators, and developers to understand and visualize complex graph algorithms, making it ideal for educational purposes and algorithm analysis.
